 <p>Hey this is Phophi and 0mpha.We've been best friends since 2019 and we"re
        still together.The past three years as friends some days were hard for
         both of us but here we are we"re still standing strong.
         We love cooking whenever we"re together we also love playing with kids.
        We're scared of losing our loved ones.We are doing the same stream.
        We also love studing together.As for phophi she enjoyes making fun of me.
        We always make sure we feel free to share our problems no matter how
         hard the situation may be.
         Our friendship had turned into a sisterhood which is  very cute.
         Our friendship consist five things which are
          love;caring;sharing;trust and honesty.We both value each other and we
          respect our parents.Our Goal is to make them happy which we are already
           doing that.Ompha is a funny person .Having a friend who love and
           respect you is a blessing.i pray to the
           almighty to bless our friendship cause the
            is no other person who can make each of us happy like we do to each
             other. may our friendship last till whenever.Even if we fought we
             still find a way to communicate.Many people have to come between us
              but we never listen to rumours and here says because we know that
              we will never  betray one an another.No matter what we go through
              we know we have each othr's back and we also support each other in everything.
      Phophi  is very rude to peoplen who try to take Ompha away from her and she
            hates people who try to provoke her friend.Phophi always stands for
            Ompha whenever people gossip about her friend.They always pray that
            their friendship should last long amd they must always keep each
            other happy.One day we're going ton travel the world together.
            And it has always been our dream to drive same cars.
